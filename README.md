# System-Modeling-and-Simulation
Project of system modeling and simulation for my major automation. 
There are three folders for the whole project.
1.Data Modeling Methods.
It contains three classic methods to process data with MATLAB:
(1) Lagrange interpolation, 
(2) Linear interpolation
(3) Least squares fitting.

2.Simulation for systems.
This folder represents simulations for several systems like pendulum system and interception system on Simulink. 
(1) Basic operations of Simulink
(2) Packaging subsystem
(3) Modeling and simulation of pendulum system
(4) Modeling and simulation of interception system

3. Reusable launch vehicle system
Utilize the forth-order RK methods to compute the change of height, speed and mass of the vehicle.
