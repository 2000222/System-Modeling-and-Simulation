# System-Modeling-and-Simulation
## Project of system modeling and simulation for my major automation. <br>
There are three folders for the whole project. <br>
### 1.Data Modeling Methods. <br>
It contains three classic methods to process data with MATLAB:<br>
(1) Lagrange interpolation <br>
(2) Linear interpolation <br>
(3) Least squares fitting <br>

### 2.Simulation for systems.<br>
This folder represents simulations for several systems like pendulum system and interception system on Simulink.<br>
(1) Basic operations of Simulink <br>
(2) Packaging subsystem <br>
(3) Modeling and simulation of pendulum system <br>
(4) Modeling and simulation of interception system <br>

### 3. Reusable launch vehicle system <br>
Utilize the forth-order RK methods to compute the change of height, speed and mass of the vehicle. <br>
